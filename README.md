# Business-Intellgience-Assessment-Challenge-2020-2021

1) With Jio coming in, we have seen an influx of internet users from Tier 2 and Tier 3. Video/Content apps like Youtube and Tiktok have seen a huge growth while Amazon/Flipkart haven’t seen similar. What could be the reason for it? Feel free to use any publicly available data to support your hypotheses.

2) New Onboarding Design at Nymtra. Nymtra is India’s leading fashion app. The Product team revamped the app’s Onboarding Flow on 31st July that introduced the following features:
    ● New walkthrough with 3 screens highlighting - extensive catalogue, free shipping for the first-order, and easy returns
    ● Added a ‘Skip Login’ option to the login screen at the end of the walkthrough
    ● Added a new “10,000+ items under ₹999” banner on the home screen.

3) Personalised Recommendations at FilmiStar
Part A:
FilmiStar is India’s #1 app for watching movies. The Product team was tasked with designing a new carousel on the home screen that will show personalised movie recommendations based on the user’s taste. Currently, the home screen shows trending and new movies only.
Questions:
1) What will be the change in user behaviour once this feature is introduced?
2) What should be the goals and metrics for this feature?
3) How should this feature be launched and evaluated?
